# Remus

Remus is a cross-platform, nix-style command-line parsing library. It is designed with simplicity, flexibility, and testability in mind while handling most basic (as well as advanced) use-cases.  It acts as a middleman between your application and the end-user, and aims to facilitate command interpretation in interactive systems.

## Features

## Getting started
Unlike other delacrative CLI frameworks, Remus relies on an attribute-based approach to define commands. The motivation behind this is to allow you to write less boilerplate and get things done faster.
